# CodeWars Code Challenges

This page represents my daily code challanges which focuse on:

  - Swift programming language.
  - Dart origramming language (occasionally).

### Organization:


  - There is one main playground which holds many sub folders.
  - Each supfolder represents a new challenge.
  - Originally they were numbered by days, then by dates, and now I just organize them by its title and difuculty raiting for clearer context.
  - Each file has a title and kata rating (kyu) (8 being easiet, 1 being the hardest).
  

 #### Each page contains:
  - Brief description of a problem.
  - My solution to a oroblem.
  - Some other clever solutions made by other users.
  - XCTests.
